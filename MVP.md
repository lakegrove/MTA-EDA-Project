## New York City MTA Analysis By Borough Pre and Post Pandenmic

![](mvp_figure.png)

The data brought in for this analysis spans back to the beginning of January 2020 up to March 20 2021. Â 

The stations have been mapped to Boroughs to look at how MTA traffic has been impacted since pre covid and how the recovery from a public transport perspective is going.

This result shows that the recovery has been minimal if at all since the pandemix started, allbeit slowely creeping up in Manhattan, the busiest Borough.

As we know, Manhattann then Brooklyn, Queens and the Brox are the busiest by order.  

We also see the spikes as weekdays, continue to be the busiest times for commuting in the city with people still going to work

This data indicates we're still at roughly about 30-40% pre corona capacity.

My next steps are really to look at how things are looking at the station level as well as plot out each Borough cumulatively.

I will then overlay covid data on Borough totals to get a sense of the interplay between the two
