# MTA-EDA-Project


**Problem Statement**:

With the onsite of COVID one year ago, we've seen a lot changes in the last year as measures have been put in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Now with vaccines coming, we are thinking of reopening cities and towns across the country and trying to work back to normal life.  Given that the subway is the way many will still need to travel in New York and due to the congestive nature of this medthod of transport, I wanted to take a look at infection rate and how it compared with foot traffic in New Yorks subway by looking at the MTA data. 

Analytical Approach
Criteria for Choosing MTA Commuter Stations
The publicly available MTA turnstile data from March 2020 was analyzed to determine the four stations that would garner the highest exposure to daily commuters. There were two criteria that were used to pinpoint these particular commuter stations:

High exit rate during the morning commute hours.
High entry rate during the afternoon and evening hours.
These two criteria would differentiate MTA stations with a high volume of commuter traffic from the other MTA stations.
