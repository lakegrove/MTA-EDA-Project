# MTA-EDA-Project


**Problem Statement**:

With the onset of COVID one year ago, we've seen many changes in the last year as measures have been put in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Now with vaccines coming and the possibility of reopening cities across the country we are entering a new phase of “returning to normal”. The goal of this analysis is really to look at MTA ridership leading into the pandemic, during the pandemic and now as we inch towards post-pandemic to see how close to “normal” things really are. 

1) How is MTA turnstile behavior changing from pre-pandemic, mid-pandemic and trending in early 2021 as the world heads to post pandemic

2) What boroughs of New York have been most impacted or seen the greatest changes in the last 15 months

3) How do seasonally similar periods of Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 compare

4)  How is data trending in Q1 2021 for ridership and how does that data look next to covid cases in New York over the last 3 months

This data has implications for public health and allowing people to know how congested these means of travel are so those that are at risk or prefer another way of getting to work or changing how they work can be informed.  Additionally, the city has a vested interest with the massive shortfall of revenues in 2020 for MTA that employs nearly 75,000 people and netted New York nearly ~$17B in 2019 this will allow them to update revenue forecasts and optimize train times and maintenance schedules better. 

**Data sets**:
