# MTA-EDA-Project


**Problem Statement**:

How is MTA turnstile behavior changing from pre-pandemic, mid-pandemic and trending in early 2021 as the world heads to post pandemic? 

With the onset of COVID one year ago, we've seen many changes in the last year as measures have been put in place to reduce the spread of the virus. Now with vaccines coming and the possibility of reopening cities across the country we are entering a new phase of “returning to normal”. The goal of this analysis is really to look at MTA ridership leading into  the pandemic, during the pandemic and now as we inch towards post-pandemic to see how close to “normal” things really are.  

We focus on the general trends of overall impact on ridership for MTA juxtaposed with COVID cases in New York City. Specifically we focus on Q1 2021 and Q1 2020 for overall ridership and a look at how cases by borough and ridership by borough has performed thus far in 2021. 

This data has implications for people to know how congested these means of travel are so those that are at risk or prefer another way of getting to work or changing how they work can be aware.  Additionally, the city has a vested interest with the massive shortfall of revenues in 2020 for MTA that employs nearly 75,000 people and netted New York nearly ~$17B in 2019.
